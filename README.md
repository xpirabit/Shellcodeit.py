# Shellcodeit.py

Shellcodeit.py is a Python 3 script created for the sole purpose of automating some of the various tasks required in custom shellcoding, in particular with regards to the SLAEx86 course. 

It's definitely not something special that I'm proud of, but at least it works, or it worked back when I wrote it.
I also used it a couple of times during my preparation for the CTP course.

It's no longer maintained. I plan however to make a new one from scratch, utilizing the amazing pwntools library.
