# Shellcodeit.py

`Shellcodeit.py` is a Python 3 script, created for the sole purpose of automating some of the various mundane tasks required in custom shellcoding, in particular with regards to the `SLAEx86 course`. 

It's definitely not something special that I'm proud of, but it works, or at least it used to work back then.
I also used it a couple of times during my preparation for the CTP course.

It's no longer maintained but it's highly unlikely that it will damage your system, unless you use it to execute unknown shellcode. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I plan however, to make a new one from scratch, utilizing the amazing `pwntools` library.
